### my first github tutorial

Hi there,

Just trying out GitHub here for the first time and experimenting with **markdown**.  

> I usually write my codes in R.  
> I work at the James Hutton Institute in Scotland as an environmental researcher.  
> It is not a bad place to work because:  
> 
> 1. You can work on diverse projects.
> 2. You have nice colleagues.
> 3. You can play snooker at lunch time :-)
